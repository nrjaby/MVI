# MVI (Model-View-Intent) Pattern for Android
## Overview

This repository demonstrates the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture pattern implementation in Android. MVI is a reactive programming pattern that provides a structured approach to managing state and handling user interactions in a consistent and predictable way.
## Features

    MVI Architecture: Easy-to-understand implementation of the MVI pattern.
    State Management: Clean management of app state using Kotlin and coroutines.
    Separation of Concerns: Clear division between model, view, and intent, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.
    Reactive UI: UI updates automatically based on the changes in the model.

## Getting Started
